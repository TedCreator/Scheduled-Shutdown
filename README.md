# Scheduled-Shutdown
<br/>
Windows proof of concept script. Asks user for hours, minutes, seconds, then sets a delayed shutdown with a timer for however long they inputted.

As of now this project is a proof of concept. I plan to develop this into a full app using C++ and Qt for a user interface, as well as with command-line integration.
